# Parking_Site
 Site that finds available parking space. 


The aim of this work is to develop a complete parking management simulation system for different cities.
 Many cities are focused on implementing intelligent city systems, including a sensor parking system on their streets. 
In this context, a simulation system was created that can work for any city. Initially the system loads cartographic data.
 The user selects a suitable KML file containing it, in the form of polygons, the building blocks of a city and the population living in each polygon.
 The system scans the file and transforms its contents (polygon outline coordinates and population), storing them in an appropriate database.
 In addition there is the possibility of deleting data. By selecting this function and after confirmation, the system deletes all the data concerning 
 the road and the population of a city. There is also the possibility to display city data. 
 The user sees on a suitable map screen with the depiction of the road of the city, which is transfered from the data base. 
 The illustration is made in the form of translucent polygons on the map, which are initially gray.
 The polygons are then colored according to the availability of parking spaces in them, during the simulation. 
 There is also the possibility of managing building blocks. The administrator can click on any polygon.
 An appropriate data entry / processing form appears for this polygon, in which the administrator can specify a) the number of parking spaces available 
 in this building block and b) the demand curve represented by this building block. 
 Finally, there is the possibility of performing an emulation where depending on the time where the user chooses, 
 it is colored in the maps of the administrator or the user depending on the percentage of occupied positions, with green (0-59%), yellow (60-84%) or red ( 85% and above).
